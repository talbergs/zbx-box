### Usage: $0 <ref>
## Creates docker ref from ref, because slash is not allowed in container names.
## Ref name is shortened, by removing a common leading "release/" or "feature/" string.
## Example:
##         $0 release/4.0
##         # This will determine ref based on \$PWD, then build postgresql database
##         # then add selenium data.sql topping.
